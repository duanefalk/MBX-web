			<h2>Differences Among Superfast Ford GTs</h2>
			<p>Through White Rose, which handled design, licensing and distribution of its NASCAR models, Matchbox released 4 versions of the Ford Thunderbird stock car, but used only 3 MAN#/'s.</p>
			<p>The easiest way to distinguish them is by the casting of the nose and grill. All four have a deep crease (referred to as the 'mail slot') between the hood and bumper.</p>
                        
                        <p>The first was MAN# 212 (UMID SF0368), released in 1992 and the only one used in a regular Matchbox series. Differentiating features are:
                        <p>1)  3 cast grill panels, two rounded above and either side of a rectangle</p>
                        <p>2)  Thunderbird is cast into the lower bumper</p>
                        <p>3)  A /'flat face/' profile- the headlight wells are not recessed</p>
                        <p>4)  There is a small notch cut into the top middle of the rear bumper. It doesn/'t extend all the way to the edge of the bumper though. </p>

                        <p></p>
 
                        <p>The second release was MAN# 268. There were, however, two toolings for this model- one in 1994 and one in 1995. There are casting differences so I/'ve broken them up into two UMID/'s /SF0697 for the /'94 and SF0899 for the /'95)</p>
                        <p>UMID SF0397:</p>
                        <p>1)  The nose has only one cast grill panel- a rectangle in the center</p>
                        <p>2)  No Thunderbird cast on the front bumpoer, thoguh it may be painted there</p>
                        <p>3)  Still has a 'flat face' profile, no recessed light wells, but does have a groove cut across the nose at the level of the grill panel</p>
                        <p>4)  Rear bumper is smooth- no notch</p>

			<p></p>
			
                        <p>UMID SF0899:</p>
                        <p>1)  The nose has no cast grill panel- it is completely smooth below the /'mail slot/'. Note that there may be grill panels painted onto the surface</p>
                        <p>2)  No Thunderbird cast on the front bumpoer, thoguh it may be painted there</p>
                        <p>3)  Still has a /'flat face/' profile, no recessed light wells</p>
                        <p>4)  Rear bumper is smooth- no notch</p>
 			<img src="images/similar_models/MAN-268-2-1.jpg" width=340>
			<p></p>
			
                        <p>The third Matchbox model was WRP02, released for the 1996-1998 NASCAR lines: </p>
                        <p>1)  The nose of the car has a clear indent of the light wells- it's no longer a flat face.</p>
                        <p>2)  There is no cast grill. Grill openings may be painted on the nose, typically with two bullet shapes above rectangles</p>
                        <p>3)  Again, no Thunderbird cast on the front bumpoer, thoguh it may be painted there</p>
                        <p>4)  The rear bumper has a distinct notch cut in the middle. Unlike 212 (SF0368), the notch covers the entire depth of the bumper</p>
