			<h2>Differences Among NASCAR Thunderbird Models</h2>
			<p>Through White Rose, which handled design, licensing and distribution of its NASCAR models, Matchbox released 4 versions of the Ford Thunderbird stock car, but used only 3 MAN#/'s.</p>
			<p>The easiest way to distinguish them is by the casting of the nose and grill. All four have a deep crease (referred to as the 'mail slot') between the hood and bumper.</p>
                        
                        <p>The first was MAN# 212 (UMID SF0368), released in 1992 and the only one used in a regular Matchbox series. Differentiating features are:
                        <p>1)  3 cast grill panels, two rounded above and either side of a rectangle</p>
                        <p>2)  Thunderbird is cast into the lower bumper</p>
                        <p>3)  A /'flat face/' profile- the headlight wells are not recessed</p>
                        <p>4)  There is a small notch cut into the top middle of the rear bumper. It doesn/'t extend all the way to the edge of the bumper though. </p>

			<p>NOTE: You may come across a version that has the grill and bumper casting of SF0368, but has chromed windows, and an unpainted metal base. This was a model Matchbox started to make in anticipation of a NASCAR set. They were unable to get the licensing though and never released the models. Somehow, many copies of the #28 Havoline and #3 Goodwrench versions they had produced made their way to the public in one of the factory moves. Be aware of these (photo of #28 below), but they are not listed as production models.</p>

                        <p>The second release was MAN# 268. There were two toolings for this model- one in 1994 and one in 1995. There is a casting differences on the nose but I've left them together in UMID SF0397 (and noted in version attachments which have the cast grill and which don't).</p>
                        <p>UMID SF0397 1994:</p>
                        <p>1)  The nose has only one cast grill panel- a rectangle in the center</p>
                        <p>2)  No Thunderbird cast on the front bumper, thoguh it may be painted there</p>
                        <p>3)  Still has a 'flat face' profile, no recessed light wells, but does have a groove cut across the nose at the level of the grill panel</p>
                        <p>4)  Rear bumper is smooth- no notch</p>

                        <p>UMID SF0397 1995:</p>
                        <p>1)  The nose has no cast grill panel- it is completely smooth below the /'mail slot/'. Note that there may be grill panels painted onto the surface</p>
                        <p>2)  No Thunderbird cast on the front bumpoer, thoguh it may be painted there</p>
                        <p>3)  Still has a /'flat face/' profile, no recessed light wells</p>
                        <p>4)  Rear bumper is smooth- no notch</p>

                        <p>The third Matchbox model was WRP02, released for the 1996-1998 NASCAR lines, under UMID SF0470: </p>
                        <p>1)  The nose of the car has a clear indent of the light wells- it's no longer a flat face.</p>
                        <p>2)  There is no cast grill. Grill openings may be painted on the nose, typically with two bullet shapes above rectangles</p>
                        <p>3)  Again, no Thunderbird cast on the front bumpoer, thoguh it may be painted there</p>
                        <p>4)  The rear bumper has a distinct notch cut in the middle. Unlike 212 (SF0368), the notch covers the entire depth of the bumper</p>
