My Dad collects Matchbox Cars.

Before he decided to move his collection to a database he was using good old Excel spreadsheets to manage a massive colelction of cars and data.
Often times the spreadsheets would crash, they were unusable.

We decided to build a website where he could document his collection but also share his cataloging system with fellow collectors.

This repository holds the code for our website, www.mbx-u.com.

Take a look at the site and feel free to talk Matchbox cars with us at info@mbx-u.com.
