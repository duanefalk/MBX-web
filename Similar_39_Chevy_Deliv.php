			<h2>Differences Between Superfast 1939 Chevy Sedan Delivery Models</h2>
			<p>The 1939 Chevy Sedan Delivery was originally commissioned by White Rose. The initial model (MB215) was too small for their requirements though, and a 2nd version (MB245) was created at a larger scale and released by that company. The original version was later used by Matchbox for several models and released as a blank for Code 2's. </p>
			<p>The easiest way to distinguish them, if you have access to the model, is to check the scale on the base. MB215 is at 1:63 scale while MB245 is 1:57. These are clearly stamped on the base.</>
                        <p>MB215 & MB245 sizes (thx to C Falkensteiner for comparison image):</p>

                        <p>Other differentiating features are:</p> 
                        <p>1)  MB215 has a distinct rear bumper; MB245 has no rear bumper</p>
                        <p>2)  Axle covers at the wheels are cast differently. MB215 has plastic covers cast to the wheels themselves. MB245 has covers cast as par tof the base. </p>
