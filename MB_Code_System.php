		<h2>The Matchbox Code System</h2>
		
		<p>One of the decisions collector's make early on is what 'code level(s)' of models they will collect. Code Level refers to how the model was manufactured, decorated and distributed. This is applicable to the miniatures and oher lines such as Models of Yesteryear and Convoys, but here, for now, refers to only the minitaures models.</p>
		<p>Code 1 models are straightforward- they are made, decorated and printed solely by the Matchbox company. These refer primarily to the standard models that fill the toy store shelves. In its early decades Matchbox factories made and finished all of their miniature models- even if the models were special promotions for a company, with a limited distribution, they were completed by Matchbox itself. One twist in the Code 1 definition is that there have been several instances where factories in China found themselves with leftover pieces and parts after the Matchbox business was relocated to another country. Those factories released many hybrid models in an effort to use up their remaining stock- mixing and matching colors, wheels and interiors in combinations never intended by Matchbox. These were sold primarily in China as 1-75's and despite being unofficial are considered Code 1. </p>
		<p> In the 90's, it was determined that running small batch special orders was not cost effective and Matchbox instead licensed secondary manufactorers to handle special decoration/print orders. These companies were authorized by Matchbox for that work. Matchbox would produce 'blanks'- versions of models that were, typically, all-white and had no decoration or printing.  The companies would then apply the final decoration per the customers' requests. The models created by that arrangement are considered Code 2 models.
		<p>There are three companies that Matchbox has authorized as Code 2 secondary manufacturers. ASAP (Advertising Specialty and Premiums) and Adtrucks (or ADT, a division of Conquer) were the first two, starting in the mid=90's. ColorComp, Inc. (CCI) originally worked with Matchbox on some Matchbox Collectibles models, and joined the list for code 2's toward the end of the 90's. CCI is the only one of them that remain in the diecast minitaures business.</p>
		<p>Some collectors and clubs also list models that were not available to the general public (i.e. line review models handed out at factory events) as Code 2. These would otherwise be listed as Code 1 since they are made by Matchbox. This approach is intended to allow collectors to achieve 'completeness' in their collection without having some very rare models. On this site, those models are listed as Code 1.</p>
		<p>Code 3 refers to any model that is altered or decorated without approval from Matchbox.</p>
		<p>Code 4 are one-off models created by Matchbox for charities or auctions or to recognize individuals. The gold Two-story buses given to each year's Matchbox Ambassador (a selected liaison from the collecting community to key Matchbox team members) and the gold-plated 2003 Seagrave Meanstick Firetruck auctioned for The Ronald McDonald House charities are examples of these.</p>
		<p>There is some ambiguity between Code 2 & 3 models, depending on who's answering the question on which is which. If a model is finished by a Code 2 authorized company, but the model itself was not vetted and approved by Mattel- is it still Code 2 or does it drop to Code 3? Of late Mattel is distancing itself from the process. They no longer produce blanks and even though there is still a stockpile of some blanks at the remaining printer, CCI, they indicate that there is no longer such a thing as a Code 2 model.</p>
		<p>This is similar to the argument about whether Pluto is a planet. By strict definition, no new Code 2 models are being produced. By popular demand though, CCI produces many customer-driven prints, using the remaining blanks or regular models, which the customers think of as Code 2. How to categorize these? Code 3 models, which previously covered mostly home-made custom jobs, are generally considered worthless in collections. In this database I;ve considered all models <i>produced by companies that have been authorized as Code 2 producers</i> to be Code 2. Mattel, for legal reasons (imagine the impact if someone put a nasty message on one of their cars and spread it around) would disagree, but since the differentiation is at least somewhat open to interpretation and the definition has changed (and may change again) over time, I believe this approach serves the greater good of the most collectors.</p>
		<p>What is truly needed is a re-definition of the whole code system that recognizes these changes and also the continuing collectibility of re-printed models.</p>	

		<p>So to summarize, on this site:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Code 1 are any model made entirely by Matchbox or at a Matchbox factory</li>
			<li>Code 2 are Code 1 models that are decorated/printed by a secondary manufacturer who has been authorized by Matchbox at some point to create Code 2's.</li>
			<li>Code 3 are models that are redecorated/reprinted outside of any authorized path, i.e. at home or by some other print shop.</li>
			<li>Code 4 are models that are typially one-offs, made only for special occassions by Matchbox. They are listed as Code 4 here.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In general the value of a model is based on a combination of quantity available and code level, at least for 1,2 and 4 (with level 4 being by far the most expensive if they are ever made available by the original receiver).</p>
