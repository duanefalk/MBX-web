		<h2>About the Photos</h2>
					
                    <p>My goal for this site is to present as comprehensive a listing as possible of Matchbox miniature models and variations. Photos of the models are, of course, a key part of such a listing.</p>
                    <p>Whenever possible I have used photos from my own collection. My collection is nowhere near as extensive as many collectors&#39 however, and there are many rare or unusual variations that I don&#39t yet have and, truly, may never see. As a result, and as is the common case with many of the extensive Matchbox web sites, I&#39ve relied on other sources for pictures of many of the models.</p>
                    <p>In all cases I attribute the photo to its source, whether my own collection (listed as MBX-u) or others. Under each photo is a reference field showing the source of the photo. A list of the most frequently used sources is available under the &#39View Reference Files&#39 menu item. There are some images that are of uncertain origin, which I list as &#39OTHER&#39.
		And since the same photo is often used across multiple Matchbox sites, it&#39s sometimes hard to tell where it&#39s from originally. I&#39ve done my best to determine that, but certainly have some of them wrong. So, if you see any photos that you know are not referenced correctly, please drop me a note with the correct information and I will fix them.</p>					
                    <p>I am still in the process of photographing my collection, and will replace  photos from other sources with my own as that proceeds. I will do the same as I acquire new models.</p>
                    <p>This is a totally non-commercial site so the images are used for informational purposes only.</p>
                    <p>In the same spirit, my photos (those marked as source &#39MBX-u&#39) can be copied and saved, and I have no issue with them being used by other Matchbox collectors. I would ask only that you reference this site as the source.</p>
		<p>Regarding my approach to my photos- my goal was to show the details of the model as clearly as possible. You&#39ll find there are 2 views at the version level (from front/ left and back/right), and 2 views for each variation (side/top and base). I&#39ve tried to show the distinguishing characteristics among versions and variations (e.g. different info on the base of the model). </p>
