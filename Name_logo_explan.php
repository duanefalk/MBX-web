			<h2>Matchbox University: The Name & Logos </h2>
			<p>People collect things, all kinds of things. There are conchologists (who collect mollusks), achtophiles (Teddy bears) and phillumenists, who collect matchboxes (the real ones, not the toys). Toys and toy trains are among the most often collected items.</p>
			<p>Why do we collect? There&#39;s the urge to obtain the &#39;complete set&#39;, the thrill of the search for the one, or many, missing pieces and the joy of finally finding them. Underlying that is the enjoyment of learning about the items and sharing what you&#39;ve learned with other enthusiasts.</p>
			<p>I think the latter is what makes Matchbox toys collecting, specifically, as satisfying as it is- its long history and the depth and breadth of information underlying it. Whether it&#39;s the Jaffa promos, pre-production models, labels vs. decals, Bulgarians and Hungarians, or just the number of variations in even the most mundane models, there is a vast &#39;lore&#39; of Matchbox that can take a lifetime to learn. It&#39;s no wonder that, among all of the diecast collector communities,  our Matchbox mavens are renowned as much for their knowledge as for their collections.  It&#39;s perfectly appropriate that some of the top-end collections are called &#39;museums&#39;.</p>
			<p>So when I was thinking about a theme for a Matchbox database web-site, the idea of a &#39;Matchbox University&#39; (or MBX-U, its url name) seemed fitting- with a motto that reflects what we all do as Matchbox collectors- Seek, Learn, Share and Enjoy!  Since the toy line has such a long history, it also seemed appropriate to have logos for the site that reflect changing styles across the corresponding decades. To that end I have three designs:</p>
			<p>-	A coat of arms: appropriate to a university, with the motto, cited above, and corresponding elements- a toy car, an open book, and a checker design reflecting the items in a collection. Note that several blocks are missing, since no collection is ever complete!   </p>
			<img src="CRESTLOGO.png"height="140">
			<p>-	A &#39;deco&#39; style logo with a grid of blocks, again representing the collection in progress.</p>
			<img src="MODLOGO.png"height="60">
			<p>-	A more modern square and circle design, with a stylized grid</p>
			<img src="MODERNLOGO.png"height="90">
			<p>These designs will appear on code 2 models, the design reflecting the era of the vehicle (i.e. the university logo will be used on classic vehicles such as the Model A)- as well as in different skins for the web site (a future upgrade).</p>
			<p>So please, look around the site- seek, learn and enjoy! And, whether it&#39;s correction of errors, interesting info about a model or a model listing or photos that I&#39;ve missed,  I&#39;m certainly grateful for what you can share! </p>
